                        <p>
                            The Bus Management System is a digital system which enables us to maintain the travelers’ details and maintain it in a record.<br>
                             It basically replaces the manual ticketing system. It also helps to calculate the total charge the traveler should pay for his journey depending on the distance travelled by him/her.<br>
                              The system’s total charge calculation part is implemented using the C programming language in Code blocks framework.<br>
                               Bus management system uses doubly linked list data structure and structures.
                        </p>

                        <P>
                            A Bus Management System helps to register and keep information about all Busses. A summary can also be generated from this system. Reports can be generated from the database records so that the Buses can be tracked and budget can be seen. In addition, this system also provides additional information for each Bus. In this project, we are trying to replace the manual ticketing system used in local buses.

                        <P>
                            In this application, first a choice will be given whether to enter or display the details.<BR>

	The traveler can enter his details and the bus staff can look through the record of the travelers at the end of the day or anytime they want. When traveler selects to enter the details, he/her have to first enter their name and then all the bus routes will be displayed. The traveler can choose the bus route and select the pickup and drop points. Then traveler will be asked whether he has the bus pass or not. Depending on these charges will be applied and appropriate messages will be displayed. The bus staff can view the record of travelers by simply selecting the option of display details.
